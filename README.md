## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility

I needed my web application to be fast so i used Next Js which is known for it's speed.

I avoided making too many API Calls and instead used context to pass my data through out my application so the data is always readily available for users instead of requesting that same information from the server again.

I stored each users information on a cookie that way, the users login and information is better secured and persists instead of using Local storage.

When registering, I added a auto generate username, email and password functionality, so users can register with ease at a click of buttons, plus they don't have to remember all this info since it's all stored on a cookie that makes sure they are always logged in of course the can all be edited later by each user if you don't like the names.

i made sure Components were reusable so i didn't have to build as much many components as i should have from screatch.

All useEfects have a dependency Array, so there's no chance of your browser crashing from too many repeated API calls.
